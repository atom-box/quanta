# Zunthum Magazine

## What's going on here
I'm building a [fake magazine site](https://atom-box.github.io/quanta/).  
<br>This should allow for lots of ways to 
integrate syntax that I'm trying out: ES5/6 functional **JS**, 
better **HTML** descriptors, **CSS**, **MongoDB** 
Deadline: CSS/HTML sorted out by June 14. Actual node server to MongoDB by June 25.
## Changelog
* Move existing four articles' contents to flat file of JSON
* Make an <aside> element appear when you mouseover the category 
* Add 4 buttons to articles: cut, info, calc, pics.
* Create buttons and subject and title classes for article CSS.
* Move logo to left and nav buttons right.  Add live navlinks.
* Adjust sizes of the navbar div elements and text.
* Add floats navbar in black.
