I am ardently pro-privacy.  I have no short-term plans to monetize this site.  But if enough people ever found this site helpful and if it ever grew large enough to need much bandwith or memory, I would look at revenue models. *None* of those revenue models will ever sell your metadata, anonymized or not, nor your email address.  Honestly, this is primarily a project to get better at building things.  Secondarily I am building it for my own use as a note-taking method.
